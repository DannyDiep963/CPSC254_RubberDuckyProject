Obtains the password of the selected network device and moves the file to the Raspberry Pi Pico
The process only takes a few seconds, and is mainly targeted at staff and students who use "eduroam"
"eduroam" is a wifi service that many universities use to simplify their network logins
Since we know the name of the network that hundreds of thousands of students and devices use, we can target them directly.
This attack can easily be modified by changing the network name and obtaining the password for that network

This works even if the user is not currently connected to the network but has it saved in their system


DuoMobile is a 2-factor authentication system that CSUF started to use and require in late 2020
However, many universities do not use this and their computers are vulnerable to this attack

Even if the attacker cannot login onto the school portal, it is likely that the password is reused for their email or bank
