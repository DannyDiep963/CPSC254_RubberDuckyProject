The laptops that you can check out from the library come with two login options
The first is "laptopuser" which only has user access and doesn't require a password
The second is "tuffy" which has an unknown password and has administrator access
This payload will log out of the laptopuser account, reset the tuffy password, and delete the laptopuser account
It also shows the bash files that the school uses to reset the computer everytime it is turned on

The importance of this script is that it allows students to download and run executable files that they couldn't run on a user account
An example is Oracle VM Box which doesn't run on the user account but runs on the administrator account

This script should run on any short term laptop that is checked out throught the TSU or the Library
